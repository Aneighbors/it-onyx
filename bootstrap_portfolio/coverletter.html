    <p>Dear Sir,</p>

         <p>I am writing to express interest in a position with your company.  As a recent graduate with experience in front-end development I believe I am a strong candidate for the position. I would love the opportunity to discuss all that I can bring to your company. I have attached my resume for you to view. </p>
          
          <p>I will have a bachelor's degree with a focus in Web Design and Devlopment and a Minor in Information Technology. I currently have a 3.9 GPA. While going to school full time, I have also been working full time all while raising a family. I say this to demonstrate just how hard working and dedicated I am. When I set my mind to something there is no stopping me. I will be an asset to your team. The programming languages that I have experience with are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
          
          <p>I am currently employed as a Radiologic Technologist at HealthCare Express. I have been in my current position for over 6 years. While working at HCE I have taken on many additional responsibilities. This is what made me pursue my degree in web design. This field is always changing, so I will always have more to learn. I enjoy coding very much, and I am so glad that I am able to do something that I enjoy doing. I look forward to bringing my love for learning and coding to your company.  </p>
          
          <p>Thank you for considering me for this position. I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
          
          <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
          
          <p>Alyson Neighbors</p>
