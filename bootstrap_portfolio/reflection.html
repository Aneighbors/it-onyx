    <p>For our project we built a website for JAPC, Jasper Advertising and Promotions Commission. Our client, the director of JAPC, Lisa Duet, came seeking our help to get a website up and running. When Mrs. Duet came to us their company just had a small portion of the city of Jasper's website. But, since they didn't manage this site, they were limited in the ways that they could change and update information. They would have to submit their changes and wait for them to get implemented once a month. JAPC's main goals are to put on and promote events in the city of Jasper. As you know many things can occur that can change the details of events taking place. So only being able to update things once a month was not very convenient.</p>
      
    <p>At first, we were told that JAPC would be utilizing TicketLeap for their ticket sales and we were trying to figure out how to input this into her website with something besides just a hyperlink. Then halfway through the project Mrs. Duet informed us that her company would not be utilizing TicketLeap anymore, they would be using Square. Square is also where they would be accepting donations. The plug-in that we were utilizing to make our forms was Gravity Forms and it works with Square, so this worked perfectly. We could use Gravity Forms to make a Donation Form, and have it attached to JAPC's Square and users could donate through this form. Another thing that our client asked for was a database to keep up with her contacts that wasn't Excel. So, we did a contact form through the Gravity forms that asked all the questions she needed. These responses are all held on the WordPress site in a database like form. It's easy to search and categorize these responses.</p>
      
    <p>Our client wanted a calendar on her site since she puts on Events. I did research on event/calendar plug ins on WordPress. The Events Calendar Plug-in seemed to be the best, so I input this into her site and put some of the event information into the calendar based on what she provided us. The look of this calendar was aesthetically pleasing, and it was easy to use. We had some issues at first when we tried to put the events on the pages, they would give us an error in loading. I couldn't figure out why this highly rated plug-in would be messing up already. Well on further inspection, there is a heading on the main page of the Plug-in that warns about utilizing certain time zones, and this happens to be the ones I used on the test run. I updated the time zones, and we haven't gotten the error since.</p>
      
    <p>This was the first website that I built through WordPress, building sites through here has its pros and cons. I prefer hard coding websites, but it may be because I am more familiar with this than I am with WordPress. We quickly learned that the themes that you pick on here can greatly influence the design of the website. Some themes restrict what you can change. So, customizing them can be difficult. Even doing your own custom CSS can be challenging because you must figure out what the theme is calling which element on the page. I can see once you are proficient in using WordPress how much easier and faster you could make websites. I will just need to do more work in WordPress and get more familiar with it.</p>
      
    <p>My team worked very hard to get this website done, overall, I think we worked well together and made a good team. Makayla was our client liaison, so she was mainly in charge of communicating with the client, Mya, Alex and I were the web developers. We all worked hard to make this a good website, we didn't have a lot of content to work with but overall, I think we succeeded in creating a site that will help JAPC more effectively and efficiently promote the city of Jasper.</p>
