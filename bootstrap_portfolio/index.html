    <h1>My Portfolio</h1> 
    <p>My name is Alyson Neighbors, I am currently working full time as a Radiologic Technologist, going to school full time for Web Design and Development, all while taking care of my family. This alone should show you how hard of a worker I will be for your company, and you will not regret bringing me onboard. I enjoy learning new things and I am so excited to be making a career change from healthcare to Web Design. </p>

      <h3>Writing Skills</h3>
        <h4>Writing Example 1</h4>
        <a href="Paper assignment 2.pdf"><img src="assests/img/writing1.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:75%" alt="Image"></a>
        <p>I wrote this paper for my Social Computing class. We collected ten research articles dealing with “Identifying Influential Bloggers.” This paper is a comparative review of goals, approaches, and findings presented in these ten articles. It was written in APA style.</p>
        <h4>Writing Example 2</h4>
        <a href="Proposal.pdf"><img src="assests/img/writing2.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:75%" alt="Image"></a>
        <p>This is a project proposal that I wrote. It details how as a community my neighborhood could work together to decrease crime in the neighborhood. This letter summarizes the problem of increased crime in our neighborhood and proposes 3 tasks that could be implemented to help minimize crime. These include forming a Neighborhood Crime Watch, increasing street lighting, and making the neighborhood a gated community. In the paper I explain how each of these will help solve the problem, and how we can go about implementing each step. </p>

        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <h4>Soft Skill Example 1</h4>
        <a class="img" href="salespeech.pdf"> <img src="assests/img/soft-skills2.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:75%" alt="Image"></a>
        <p>This is a PowerPoint presentation that I presented as a Sales speech about myself, and why I would make a good teammate, and now a good employee. This is my personality type, and it speaks volumes about me: “Adventurers are tolerant and friendly, & usually just do what needs to be done regardless of whether their colleagues pull their own weight.”</p> 
        <h4>Soft Skill Example 2</h4>
        <a href="Course_Takeaway.pdf"><img src="assests/img/soft-skills1.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:75%" alt="Image"></a>
        <p>This paper reflects all that I learned in my Mobile Web Development class Spring 2023. I worked hard and greatly enjoyed this class, and I learned a lot. Reading through this paper just a semester later I know how much further my skills have grown, and I can’t wait to take my skills even further.</p>

        <h3>Web Examples</h3>
        <h4>Web Example 1</h4>
        <a href="../final-project/index.html"> <img src="assests/img/jasper-web1.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:75%" alt="Image"></a>
        <p>For this website, our two clients came to us in hopes that we could help get them a site up and running. They had a cabin and canoes for rent in Jasper, Arkansas and wanted a way to advertise and be able to rent these out to people. Another thing they specifically asked for were graphs that would show the river levels by pulling through an API. I think that we were able to build a beautiful site that met our client’s needs.</p>
        <h4>Web Example 2</h4>
        <a href="https://web-projects.net/jasper/"> <img src="assests/img/webproj2.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:75%" alt="Image"></a>
        <p>For this project we built a website for JAPC, Jasper Advertising and Promotions Commission. Our client, the director of JAPC, Lisa Duet, came seeking our help to get them a website up and running. When Mrs. Duet came to us their company just had a small portion of the city of Jasper's website. But, since they didn't manage this site, they were limited in the ways that they could change and update information. I feel that through this website JAPC will be able to promote the city of Jasper more efficiently and effectively.</p><a href="https://5500-aneighbors-itonyx-tm96p39ijo5.ws-us106.gitpod.io/final-project/index.html">Web-2</a>
